How to provision a Pi

Download the OS image .zip provided by http://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads
Unzip

In the terminal:
locate the disk number for the SD card
	On a mac, " diskutil list " will provide a display of each device and volume. The identifier you want is going to look like " /dev/disk2 " and the volumes 

sudo dd if=<path_of_your_image.img> of=/dev/r<diskn> bs=1m

When done, eject the SD card and install in a Pi, give the Pi power and wait a few minutes for it to boot and configure itself.

Give the Pi an IP address on your network; for example, use your machine to bridge wifi to ethernet, and read your registry of assigned DHCP addresses in (on a mac) /private/var/db/dhcpd_leases
ssh into the Pi:
	ssh pi@<pi's IP address>
	When prompted for a password, provide "raspberry"

------
NOTE: If you receive a scary warning about RSA keys, you have probably authenticated with a previous device over SSH using the same IP address. This is fine, but means you need to delete the previous entry in your known_hosts file.
This is located (on a mac) at /private/var/db/dhcpd_leases
Delete the line that corresponds to the IP address you are trying to use.
------


First, run " sudo raspi-config " to launch the configuration utility
	In "Advanced Options," update the config utility itself
	On the main menu, run "Expand Filesystem"
	Finish, and DO NOT reboot.
	
Run:

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade -y

THIS MIGHT TAKE A WHILE; go get a coffee.
When done reboot the Pi; sudo shutdown -r now && exit
Wait a few minutes, and SSH in again; ssh pi@<pi's IP address>
Verify you can connect, and then shut down; sudo shutdown -h now && exit
	Alternatively, take this time to install additional tools or resources. For example, running the Setup.sh script contained in this repository. Then shut down.
When the only LED turned on is the RED power light, unplug the Pi.

Done!

For imaging a large number of SD cards, it may be beneficial to perform a raw copy of the card at this point, and image it onto future cards instead of the fresh image. For this you can perform another dd command; dd
